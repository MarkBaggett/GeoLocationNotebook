You will need this virtual machine to fully participate in the lab. You can download that [HERE](https://tinyurl.com/locatehacker)​ with the password "`whereRUhacker?​`" 

If you are unable to get the Virtual Machine downloaded and working for some reason, you can still participate with most of the workshop by using the binder link below. **NOTE: Approximatly 15% of the material covered will not work properly if you choose to use the website below instead of the virtual machine.**
